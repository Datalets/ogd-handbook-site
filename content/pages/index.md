#### About this site

The project “OGD Switzerland” is conducted by the [Swiss Federal Archives SFA](http://www.bar.admin.ch/themen/01648/01968/index.html?lang=en). Different working teams are responsible for measures set out in the OGD Strategy of Switzerland - for instance: the analysis of the legal framework, the development of the [opendata.swiss](http://opendata.swiss) portal, and the creation of the OGD Handbook.

The OGD Handbook should support individuals with responsibilities for data publishing at their government department, as well as the wider user base. For these reasons we plan to integrate with the OGD portal and provide a centrally accessible, evolving knowledge base.

The structure of the OGD Handbook will be based around visual and contextual representations of the process of data publishing, providing an up-to-date reference for actual and potential data owners. Relevant documentation created as part of the OGD Switzerland project, as well as references from OGD projects around the world, will be discoverable within.

We have already interviewed a number of organisations involved in the use and publication of OGD about their organisational readiness from the standpoint of knowledge sharing. The OGD Handbook team continues to gather feedback with a focus on evaluating the structure, quality and usability of learning materials. Such activities help us to be aware of best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing between stakeholders.
