A growing number of documents have been released as part of the Open Government Data (OGD) Switzerland project, corresponding to the work areas of the implementation of the national OGD Strategy. These are primary sources for the OGD Handbook, which you can view in condensed form and download here:

The [Open Government Data Strategy for Switzerland](http://www.egovernment.ch/umsetzung/00881/00883/index.html?lang=en) and [supporting studies](http://www.egovernment.ch/dokumentation/studien/index.html?lang=en) provide additional background.

## International references

The **Open Data Handbook** is a primary inspiration for this project, of note are the history and structure of the community effort. It was initially developed by the [Open Government Data Working Group](http://opengovernmentdata.org/) of [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org), and is now maintained by a network of contributors:

- Visit [OpenDataHandbook.org](http://opendatahandbook.org/) ([Repository](https://github.com/okfn/opendatahandbook/), [Wiki](http://wiki.okfn.org/Projects/Open_Data_Handbook), [Mailing list](https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-data-handbook))
- See [Localised Guides](http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/wiki/Localised_Guides) at the Share-PSI working group of W3C for links to more guides and handbooks.

A forerunner of OGD in Switzerland, the Swiss association for Open Data **Opendata.ch** has a manifesto based on mutually agreed principles relevant to this project, regularly maintained feeds with currents and analysis, and community resources:
